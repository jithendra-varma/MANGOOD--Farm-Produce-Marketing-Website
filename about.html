            <h2>Our Village K.B.R.Puram.</h2>
            <p>Mango is also known as the king of all fruits,is also the national fruit of our country. For a certain fruit to be declared as a national fruit, it should have certain characteristics. First of all, it should represent the complete country i.e. India. The different varieties of mango represent the different cultures, societies, casts, races and mindsets in India. It is a symbol of cultural diversity.</p>
